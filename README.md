This report reframes Cypronetics’s security posture through the lens of **Multi-Agentic AI**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **AI-driven Agent ecosystems**, applying industry best practices from:  

# Cypronetics Multi-Agentic AI Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) and LLM Audit Report – Q1 2025

---

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)**  
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)**
- **NIST AI RMF Playbook** 
- **MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems)**  
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**  
- **ISO/IEC 23894:2023 (AI Risk Management)**  
- **AI Regulatory Standards** (EU AI Act, U.S. AI Executive Orders)  

Key outcomes:  
- Strong IAM foundations are in place (least privilege in Terraform).  
- Major gaps in **AI governance, adversarial detection, and incident response**.  
- High-risk exposures to **prompt injection, data poisoning, and supply chain compromise**.  
- A lack of **AI-specific policies, risk registers, and governance structures**.  
- Regulatory alignment is partial; EU AI Act obligations are not yet mapped.  

**Target Objective:** Elevate Cypronetics to **Tier 4 (Adaptive)** maturity for AI security, ensuring resilience against adversarial AI threats while maintaining compliance with global regulations.  

---

## Methodology

The audit methodology follows a **multi-framework alignment** process:

1. **Framework Mapping**  
   - Mapped NIST CSF 2.0 functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) to AI/LLM security dimensions.  
   - Integrated NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 23894, MITRE ATLAS adversarial cases, and OWASP LLM risks.  

2. **Assessment Scope**  
   - Covers Cypronetics’s **five-agent architecture** (Planner, Reporter, Researcher, Retirement, Scheduler).  
   - Includes **model supply chain security**, **data handling**, **agent-to-agent communications**, and **cloud IAM**.  
   - Focuses on adversarial ML threats including **prompt injection**, **data poisoning**, **membership inference**, and **model evasion**.  

3. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - Tier-based maturity assessment: Tier 1 (Partial) → Tier 4 (Adaptive).  
   - Compliance crosswalk against **EU AI Act risk categories**, **U.S. NIST AI RMF**, and **global GRC best practices**.  
   - Review of existing policies, technical controls, and organizational governance.

## Audit Findings by CSF Function

---

### 1. Govern – AI Governance & Accountability

**Findings:**  
- Cypronetics lacks a **formal AI governance structure** to oversee risks across its agentic AI systems.  
- No **AI accountability framework** defining roles, responsibilities, or ethical oversight.  
- Missing **AI-specific policies** (acceptable use, agent interaction protocols, AI fairness guidelines).  
- No established **AI Risk Register** documenting adversarial risks like data poisoning or prompt injection.  
- No integration of **compliance readiness** for **EU AI Act** or **ISO/IEC 23894** requirements.  

**Impact:**  
Without governance, AI systems operate without accountability, exposing Cypronetics to **legal, ethical, and operational risks**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ Fail  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Establish an **AI Governance Committee** reporting to the Board.  
2. Create an **AI Risk Register** aligned with NIST AI RMF.  
3. Define **AI model accountability policies** (bias monitoring, explainability, fairness).  
4. Integrate **regulatory scanning** for compliance with EU AI Act and U.S. Executive Orders.  
5. Implement **AI ethical review boards** for high-risk use cases.

<img width="1740" height="1565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c25e7c8-162f-4adc-87ba-dfccd9ad9f57" />

---

### 2. Identify – AI Assets, Risks & Supply Chain

**Findings:**  
- No centralized **AI asset inventory** covering agents, APIs, datasets, or embeddings.  
- Limited awareness of **third-party model dependencies** (LLM APIs, pretrained models).  
- No **model provenance tracking** to verify lineage of training data and updates.  
- No **SBOM for AI models**, increasing supply chain exposure.  
- Lack of **data risk classification** for training and inference datasets.  

**Impact:**  
Unidentified AI assets and supply chain blind spots create **shadow AI risks** and **compliance blind spots**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ Fail  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Build a **complete AI Asset Inventory** (agents, datasets, APIs, models).  
2. Enforce **AI SBOM requirements** (Model Bills of Materials).  
3. Track **model provenance** using cryptographic signatures.  
4. Classify **datasets by risk sensitivity**.  
5. Integrate **vendor risk assessments** for external AI/LLM providers.

**Findings:**  
- IAM uses **least privilege**, but agent-to-agent access is overly permissive.  
- No restrictions on **cross-agent data sharing**.  
- Missing controls for **prompt injection**, **model inversion**, or **embedding exfiltration**.  
- No **data isolation** between training and inference pipelines.  
- No **AI cryptographic integrity checks** for models and datasets.  

**Impact:**  
Adversaries could **inject malicious prompts**, **steal embeddings**, or **compromise agents**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ⚠️ Partial  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Apply **zero-trust IAM** to all AI agents.

---

### 4. Detect – AI Threat Monitoring & Adversarial Detection

**Findings:**  
- Monitoring is limited to infrastructure logs.  
- No **AI adversarial telemetry** (prompt anomaly detection, data poisoning indicators).  
- No **model drift monitoring** or **bias emergence tracking**.  
- No integration of **MITRE ATLAS red-team scenarios**.  
- Lack of **real-time monitoring dashboards** for AI behaviors.  

**Impact:**  
Attacks on LLMs or agents could go **undetected**, leading to **silent compromise**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ Fail  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Deploy **AI-native monitoring tools** for adversarial detection.  
2. Implement **continuous telemetry** for prompt injection and data poisoning attempts.

**Findings:**  
- Incident response playbooks exist but are **generic IT-focused**.  
- No **AI-specific playbooks** for adversarial ML events.  
- No **rollback strategies** for compromised models.  
- No defined **regulatory notification processes** for AI-related incidents.  
- No **forensic logging** for AI agent communications.  

**Impact:**  
Cypronetics cannot effectively respond to **AI incidents**, exposing it to **regulatory penalties** and **operational disruption**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ Fail  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Create **AI-specific IR playbooks** (prompt injection, data poisoning, agent compromise).  
2. Develop **rollback & quarantine procedures** for poisoned models.  
3. Establish **AI forensic logging** for agent interactions.  
4. Define **AI breach disclosure protocols** for regulators.  
5. Integrate IR with **AI governance board escalation paths**.

---

### 6. Recover – AI Recovery & Resilience

**Findings:**  
- Recovery strategies focus on infrastructure, not AI-specific resilience.  
- No **fallback AI models** or **hot-swappable agents**.  
- No **resilience testing** (chaos engineering for AI, adversarial stress testing).  
- No **post-incident AI risk reassessment**.  
- No **continuous improvement cycle** for AI security posture.  

**Impact:**  
AI incidents could result in **long-term outages**, **loss of trust**, and **data integrity issues**.  

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ Fail  

**Recommendations:**
